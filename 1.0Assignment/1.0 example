// Pseudocode example of BMI health calculator

----Health Slip----

Male Subject: Andrew Vargas;    
Current age: 20 years & 9 months = 249 months total;  // input all subjects statistics
Height: 6 feet & 3 inches = 75 inches total;
Current Weight: 200 lbs;
Activity level: 1,200 (no excercise) 

Harris Benedict Equation: 66 + (6.23 * 200 lbs) + (12.7 * 75 inches) - (6.8 * 20 years) = BMR; // Achieving BMR for subject
                        
The Mifflin: (10 * weight in kilo) + (6.25 * height in cm) - (5 * age in years) + 5 = BMR;

Total Calorie Intake = activity level * BMR

Maintaining Food item: Still have to decide?
